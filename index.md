This collection of lessons will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

This is an advanced workshop, and the basics of the R progamming language will not be covered.

This session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry package `actel`. We then explore multiple ways to animate fish tracks, exploring `gganimate` and `pathroutr`, and finally we introduce some quality control functions from `remora`.
